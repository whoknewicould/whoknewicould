# 👋 Hi, I’m Akhil  
**Robotics & AI Systems Engineer**  

I design adaptive systems  robots, simulations, and intelligent tools built to move with human rhythm instead of hustle. My work sits at the edge of **mechanics, AI, and design**, with one aim: creating systems that are clear, reliable, and human-centered.

## 🔬 What I’m Exploring

- 🤖 **Humanoid Robotics** → Safe, intuitive, emotionally aware.  
- ⚡ **Adaptive Automation** → Robotics that flex with real-world energy.  
- 🧠 **Neuro-adaptive Tools** → Calendars & second brains that respect focus cycles.  
- 🛠️ **Robotics Stack** → ROS2 · Gazebo · MuJoCo · Isaac Sim · Sensor Fusion · Embedded AI  

---

## 🌱 My Approach

- **Code as Craft** → Clean, resilient, purposeful.  
- **Design with Clarity** → Minimal, accessible, deeply human.  
- **Systems that Adapt** → Technology that recovers with you, not against you.  

---

## 💡 Outside the Code

- 🌿 Growing plants while debugging minds.  
- 🐈 Learning awareness from cats (my best co-researchers).  
- 🎮 Anime as philosophy: *Steins;Gate* (time), *Psycho-Pass* (ethics), *Edgerunners* (survival), *Erased* (memory).  
- ☕ Purpose over caffeine. Futures over trends.

## 📌 Current Work

- **Zeo** → Building intelligent, adaptive tools for real life.  
- **Zentrum** → A mood-aware calendar that follows energy, not hours.  
- **Neuronote** → A voice-first second brain tuned for neurodivergent focus.  
- Researching child-safe humanoids → Machines that sense, learn, and respond with care.

## ✨ Guiding Thought

> “If it doesn’t adapt, it doesn’t survive  if it adapts well, it helps others thrive.”
